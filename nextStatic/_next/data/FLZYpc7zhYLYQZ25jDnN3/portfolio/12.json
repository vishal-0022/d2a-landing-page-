{"pageProps":{"projectObj":{"id":"12","name":"","address":"NOIDA","type":"Residential","description":"This bedroom design revolves around one piece of furniture in particular, while the bed is usually the main event. It's the oft overlooked supporting cost of furniture and decoration that can help to bring the best in the bedroom. This bedroom’s colour makes all the difference to set the right mood in their room. No matter what style of the room a well lifted space is the key to a good ambience and our team has been worked out. \nThis colour combination is a classic but our team here have managed to give a unique touch to it. It looks smart and radiates simplicity but at the same time is not dull or mundane. A soft brown wooden wall colour, a tube top wash basin and some basic steel hardware bathroom accessories complete the bathroom’s look.","image":["/Assets/Projects/12-0.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/12-1.jpeg"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
