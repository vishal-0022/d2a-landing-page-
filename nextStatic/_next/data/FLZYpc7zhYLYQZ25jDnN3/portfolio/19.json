It is our first turnkey project, located in Noida Sector - 125 for a MBA businessman. He needs a different design from all nearby cafes. The site is very far for our team but they did the finest work with dedication. The chairs are designed by Tarun Aggarwal Designer in Noida Sec - 63 and tables are assembled by our designers. The tables have high glossy laminate on top with steel support with spray paint. \nThe client wants a different look for every wall, so our team makes walls with different looks like WPC boards with spray paint which creates a green look with a decorated green wall. \nThe circular particle boards on the wall are making a visual focal point. Strip lights surrounding the board enhance the focal point of the wall. \nServing area has an existing plywood board ceiling which is reinstalled after polish. Hanging rectangular boxes with light are also made by existing plywood boards. \nWe used existing plywood board to make the sofa and Tv unit fabric is selected by designers for the sofa set. Designers make a good bond with carpenters and are enthusiastic about the work environment. \nThe ceiling is a main part of every design thatâ€™s why our designers make a unique combo of horizontal PVC board and circular particle board with lights.\n    ","image":["/Assets/Projects/19-0.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-1.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-2.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-3.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-4.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-5.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-6.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-7.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-8.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-9.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-10.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-11.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-12.jpeg","/Assets/Projects/19-13.jpeg"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
